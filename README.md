# SJH-Portfolio-v2

This project is the second iteration of the SJH-Portfolio, a series of sample portfolios to show the progress made during the coding boot camp. Because this is the second iteration, it is not my real portfolio just yet, and as such may have missing information or dead links. 

The second iteration of the SJH-Portfolio is designed entirely with Tailwind, unlike the first iteration that was made with pure CSS. In addition, the design has been modernized and looks like a webpage made within the last decade. 

Also departing from the first iteration, v2 has a js file that will handle local scripts and will be filled in the future as more features are added.
## GitHub

This project is on an open repo on my GitHub account at [this link](https://github.com/jhahnsheen/SJH-Portfolio-v2). Additionally, the page is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://jhahnsheen.github.io/SJH-Portfolio-v2/) as well. 

## Project Status

This project, as made obvious by the title, is the second iteration and there will be more in the future with newer layouts and features.
